# Day 01-2:1 MUX using behavioral Verilog
🔀 2:1 Multiplexer – Behavioral Verilog
This project implements a 2:1 multiplexer using behavioral modeling in Verilog. A multiplexer (MUX) selects one of two input signals (i1 or i2) based on a control signal (a) and routes it to the output (x).

# Day 03- 1-bit Full Adder.
🔀 1-bit Full Adder -
This project implements a 1-bit Full Adder using Verilog. A Full Adder takes three inputs (a, b, and cin) and produces two outputs: sum and cout. It is a basic building block used in arithmetic circuits such as adders and ALUs.

# Day 04- 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder.
🔀 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder-
This project implements a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) using Verilog HDL. The design consists of a basic full adder module and a top-level RCA module built by cascading four full adders. A testbench is also provided for functional simulation.

# Day 05- 4-bit Subtractor.
🔀 4-bit Subtractor-
This project implements a 4-bit binary subtractor using Verilog HDL. The subtractor is constructed using XOR gates and full adder logic by taking the 2's complement of the second input. The design includes a main subtractor module and a testbench for simulation.
